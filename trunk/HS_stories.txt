Collaborative photo sharing and gossiping of the local community.

A picture is worth 1,000 words. Stop talking and start showing!

Share your story or unique occurrence in Berkeley or any campus, for that

matter, to the student population.

Users can upload or email in photos of campus personalities, protesters,

hippies, the popular girl, or the campus jock at their finest moments.

Viewers are welcome to comment with their insight or link to other

relevant photos.

Rank the hottest girl. The most "granola" Berkeleyan. Most awkward geek.

 

Potentially, looking to offer user the opportunity to order posted photos as

posters, calendars, and other paraphernalia.
